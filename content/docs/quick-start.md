## 0. Introduction

Starting from a new installation, we will configure a user who will be able to make and receive calls via a SIP trunk.

{{% alert note %}}
This quick start is not specific to sparrow and can very well be used with a Wazo engine.

## 1. Login to the administration interface

The administation interface named `wazo-ui` is available on port `443` of your engine you can access it through an internet browser.

To log in use the user `root` and the password that you defined at the beginning of the installation.

## 2. Use tenants

### Meaning of multi-tenant
Wazo is a multi-tenant IPBX, this means that it is possible for a telephony provider to have more than one customer on the same IPBX.

A customer is compartmentalized in his environment and is not aware of users outside his company.

### Select your tenant

At the top left of the interface there is a drop-down menu, it allows you to select the tenant that you are configuring.

After installation there are two tenants on your system: 
* `master`
* `sparrow`


{{% alert warning %}}
The `master` tenant is only used by the system.
You don't have to do any configuration inside it !
{{% /alert %}}

## 3. Create contexts
In the `‚öôÔ∏è Advanced > üîÄ Contexts` menu we will create 3 contexts:
* `internal` context which will contain the system numbers
* `outgoing` context which will contain calls to outside
* `incall` context which will contain calls from outside

Parameter to be filled in for the internal context:
* Name: `sparrow-internal`
* Label: `sparrow-internal`
* Type: `Internal`

Parameter to be filled in for the incall context:
* Name: `sparrow-from-extern`
* Label: `sparrow-from-extern`
* Type: `Incall`

Parameter to be filled in for the outgoing context:
* Name: `sparrow-to-extern`
* Label: `sparrow-to-extern`
* Type: `Outcall`

Once the contexts are created edit the `sparrow-internal` context for:
* include the `sparrow-to-extern` context
* declare a number range for the users

![include-from-extern](/img/quick-start/include-to-extern.png)

![user-range](/img/quick-start/user-range.png)

Finally edit the `sparrow-from-extern` context to add a range for incoming calls.

## 4. Create a user

A `User` is a telephone user, he can have one or more lines, one or more DIDs,
one or more devices, he can be assigned call rights, groups ...

To create one go to the `üë§ User` menu and add a user with the following parameters:
* Firstname: `Sparrow`
* Name: `User`
* Email: `no@ma.il`
* Passoword: `secret`
* Context: `sparrow-internal`
* Number: `100`
* Protocol: `SIP`

![user-creation](/img/quick-start/user-creation.png)

To use this user with a SIP telephone, you can go to the `üîÅ line` menu, edit your user's line and retriver the auto-generated `Username` and the `Password`.

## 5. Create a SIP trunk

A trunk sip allows a link between 2 systems using the SIP protocol.
Operators can enable calls to the public network via a SIP trunk.

To add a SIP trunk go to the `üíª Trunk` menu.

The configuration of a SIP trunk is complex and depends on your operator.
We won't go into detail about the configuration options of a trunk here.

For the example we are going to create one with minimum parameters:
* Name: `sparrow-trunk`
* Username: `sparrow-trunk`
* Host: `Dynamic`
* Context: `sparrow-from-external`.

## 6. Create a incall rule

An incall rule makes it possible to associate a number provided by the operator with an internal resource.

To create one go to the `‚û°Ô∏è Incalls` menu and add a entry with the following parameters:
* Context: `sparrow-from-extern`
* Number: `0100000000`
* Destination: `User`
* User: `Sparrow User`

![incall-creation](/img/quick-start/incall-creation.png)

## 7. Create a outcall rule
An outgoing call rule allows calls to be routed to the trunk operator.

In our example we will route all the numbers not known by the system to the trunk we have created.

To create a outcall rule go to the `‚¨ÖÔ∏è Outcalls` menu and add a entry with the following parameters:
* Name: `to-sparrow-trunk`
* Trunks: `sparrow-trunk (sip)`
* Context: `sparrow-to-extern`
* Extension: `_X.`

## 8. Conclsion
We have seen how to start from a virgin installation, how to create a user and create an interconnection with an operator.
