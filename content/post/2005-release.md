Sparrow version 20.05 is available.

## Changelog

The software release notes are the same as Wazo platform and available here: [20.05](https://wazo-platform.org/blog/release-review-2005).

## News

Since the previous release I produced a [quick start](../../docs/quick-start), which describes the first actions to perform on its installation.

## Upgrade

The update procedure is identical to Wazo.
You just have to run `wazo-upgrade`
